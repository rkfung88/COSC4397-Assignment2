# COSC4397-Assignment2

Unity Car Theme Project:

The first 3D object I designed through Maya was an "Do not enter" street sign. I choose to create this object to keep with the same concept as the 3D object I downloaded from TurboSquid. 
1) In order to rotate the 3D object, there will be a slider on the bottom left hand corner which will allow the object to be roatate clockwise and counterclock wise.
2) To switch 3d objects,simply hit S on the keyboard and a 3D model of a DeLorean will appear.
3) In order to scale the object,make sure the canvas is selected in the Inspector in order to scale the object across all 3 axis.
