# COSC4397-Assignment2

Unity Car Theme Project:

The first 3D object I designed through Maya was an "Do not enter" street sign. I choose to create this object to keep with the same concept as the 3D object I downloaded from TurboSquid. 
1) In order to rotate the 3D object, there will be a slider on the bottom left hand corner which will allow the object to be roatate clockwise and counterclock wise.
2) To switch 3d objects,simply hit D on the keyboard and a 3D model of a DeLorean will appear. In order to switch back to the sign, simply hit S on the keyboard.
3) In order to scale the object,make sure the canvas is selected in the Inspector in order to scale the object across all 3 axis.

NOTE: The swapping of 3D objects will only take place after the rotation slider is used (Slight bug that occurs from time to time when the program is ran). In other words,
you can only swap an object while in rotation or after rotating it but not after scaling.
